# Computer Architecture (CoE 301)

This repository contains the coursework, assignments, and the final project for the **CoE 301: Computer Architecture** course. The projects focus on the fundamental principles of computing systems, ranging from Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) design to hardware implementation and performance optimization.

## � Course Overview

**Computer Architecture** explores the interface between hardware and software. This course covers the design, analysis, and implementation of computer systems, emphasizing:
*   **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: MIPS/RISC-V assembly language and datapath design.
*   **Processor Design**: Single-cycle, multi-cycle, and pipelined processor implementations.
*   **Memory Hierarchy**: Cache organization, virtual memory, and performance trade-offs.
*   **Digital Logic Design**: Verilog/VHDL implementation of arithmetic logic units (ALUs) and control units.

## 📂 Repository Contents

### [Final Project Report](CoE301-Final-Project.pdf)
A comprehensive documentation of the final course project. This report details the design methodology, architectural decisions, and performance analysis of the implemented system.
*   **Key Focus**: Architectural design, simulation results, and performance metrics.
*   **Outcome**: Demonstrated valid operation of the designed architecture through rigorous testing and simulation.

### [Assignment 2: Architecture Analysis](CoE301-Assignment-2.pdf)
Detailed solutions and technical analysis for the second course assignment. 
*   **Topics Covered**: ISA datapath analysis, performance calculation, or assembly programming concepts (specific topics as covered in the assignment).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

The projects in this repository may involve the use of standard industry tools for design and simulation:
*   **Hardware Description Languages**: Verilog / VHDL
*   **Simulation Tools**: ModelSim, Vivado, or QtSpim/MARS (for Assembly)
*   **Documentation**: LaTeX / Word for technical reporting
